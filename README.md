# Audio-Segmentation-and-Transcription

Project Description:
This project, titled "Audio Segmentation and Transcription Using PyDub and Whisper," represents a demonstration of audio processing and natural language processing skills in the context of a two-way conversation. 
In this assignment, we leverage the capabilities of PyDub and Whisper within Google Colab to separate and transcribe a conversation between two participants, such as a customer service call. 
The ultimate goal is to create a JSON file that encapsulates the segmented and transcribed conversation, while distinguishing between the caller and the callee.

**Key Components of the Project:**

1. **Google Colab Setup:** We begin by establishing our project environment in Google Colab. We configure the runtime settings and install the necessary Python libraries, including PyDub and Whisper, to facilitate audio processing and transcription.

2. **Audio Segmentation with PyDub:** We utilize PyDub, a versatile audio processing library, to load the audio file containing the conversation. Using PyDub's functionalities, we separate the audio into distinct segments corresponding to the caller and the callee.
3.  This segmentation process can be based on various criteria, such as speaker identification, silence detection, or predefined time intervals.

4. **Transcription with Whisper:** The next step involves using Whisper, an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system developed by OpenAI, to transcribe the segmented audio clips.
5. We submit the audio segments to Whisper for transcription, transforming spoken words into textual form.

6. **JSON File Creation:** With the segmented and transcribed conversation data in hand, we construct a JSON file that organizes the conversation in a structured manner.
7.  This JSON file will clearly differentiate between the speaker roles (caller and callee) and provide a timestamped representation of the conversation's progression.

**Benefits and Learning Outcomes:**

- Acquired hands-on experience in audio processing and natural language processing using PyDub and Whisper.
- Developed skills in working with audio data, including segmentation and transcription techniques.
- Gained proficiency in using Google Colab for data science and machine learning projects.
- Explored the power of automatic speech recognition (ASR) and its real-world applications.
- Learned to organize and structure data in JSON format for easy analysis and sharing.
